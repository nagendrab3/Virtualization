What is Virtualization?

Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over physical computer hardware. This abstraction allows the hardware components of a single computer — such as processors, memory, storage, and more — to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called **virtual machines (VMs).

Each VM operates like a separate physical machine, with its own operating system and applications.

What is a Hypervisor?

Red Hat Definition:  
A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor, sometimes called a virtual machine monitor (VMM), isolates the hypervisor operating system and resources from the virtual machines and enables the creation and management of those VMs.

Types of Hypervisors

There are two main types of hypervisors:

1. Bare-Metal Hypervisors (Type 1)  
   - Installed directly on the physical hardware  
   - Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen, KVM  
   - Does not require a host OS

2. Hosted Hypervisors (Type 2) 
   - Runs on top of a host operating system  
   - Examples: VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels  
   - Requires a base OS to function

Bare-Metal vs Hosted Hypervisors

| Feature                | Bare-Metal Hypervisor          | Hosted Hypervisor               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Performance            | Better, direct hardware access | Slight overhead due to host OS  |
| Stability              | More stable and scalable       | Dependent on host OS stability  |
| Driver Compatibility   | Limited driver support         | Broad driver support via host OS|
| Use Cases              | Enterprise, data centers       | Personal use, development       |

Types of Virtualization

There are several different types of virtualization used in computing:

- Operating System Virtualization 
  (e.g., VMs running different OSes on a host system)
  
- Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) 
  (virtualizing networking services like routers, firewalls, etc.)
  
- Desktop Virtualization  
  (allowing users to access a desktop environment remotely)

Is Containerization a Type of Virtualization?

Yes — containerization is considered a form of operating-system-level virtualization.

- Unlike traditional virtualization, containers share the host OS kernel
- Each container runs in isolated user-space, making them lightweight and fast
- Tools like Docker and Pod man implement container-based virtualization

How Virtual Machines Changed the Industry

The introduction of virtual machines transformed the IT landscape by:

- Enabling multiple applications to run securely on the same physical hardware
- Increasing hardware utilization and cost efficiency
- Improving security and isolation through separation of workloads
- Simplifying testing and deployment environments

Are Virtual Machines Still Relevant in the Age of Containers?

Yes — virtual machines still play a critical role, even with the rise of containers.

Why VMs Still Matter:
- Offer full OS-level isolation
- Can run different operating systems on the same host
- Better for legacy applications and complex workloads
- Provide stronger security boundaries (since they do not share a kernel)

Limitations of Containers:
- Share the host kernel — potential security risks
- Cannot run different operating systems (e.g., Windows container on Linux host)
