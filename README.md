Virtualization is a foundational technology in modern computing that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical system by abstracting hardware resources.

Using software called a hypervisor, virtualization enables organizations to increase hardware utilization, improve application isolation, and scale infrastructure efficiently.

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of virtualization including types of hypervisors, benefits, limitations and its relevance in today container-driven environments.
